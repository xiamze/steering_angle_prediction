# steering_angle_prediction
This project develops a camera-based steering angle prediction with Keras and Udacity simulator.

Autonomous driving has been the most prevalent topic for years and also humanâ€™s ultimate imagination about cars. Among all technologies that comprise vehicle autonomy, computer vision plays a key role as it processes images with rich and direct information. Compared to other technologies like radar, which provides only limited surrounding information through complicated processing, computer vision offers methods to detect and model every image element in a stable, efficient way with lower cost. Along with our Neural Network topics, we have made an easy attempt to enable vehicle autonomy with CNN, training a CNN steering angle predictor and loading the model in simulation to test its performance.
